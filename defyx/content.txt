The idea for Defyx was born on the second Tuesday of February — which happened to be Safer Internet Day.

That day, a group of us — developers and tech enthusiasts — came together and decided to build a secure and efficient app called #DefyxVPN: a cross-platform VPN for both mobile and desktop.

We kicked things off right then and there, and today, the beta version of Defyx is available on TestFlight for iPhone.

If you'd like to be among the first to try it out, we’d love to hear from you.
Just shoot us an email at defyx@unboundtech.de, and feel free to share your feedback or ideas after giving the app a go.

Hello, world!
We built #DefyxVPN to make the internet safer, freer, and more open for everyone.
We’re still deep in the ones and zeros — crafting every detail with care — to bring you a tool that feels like a trustworthy companion. Something you can rely on, use with ease, and count on when things get tough.

If internet freedom matters to you, we’re right here with you.
Stay tuned — exciting updates are on the way.

We don’t just believe in #transparency and open source — we live by it.
As soon as we move out of beta, you’ll be able to browse the full documentation and source code on #GitHub.
It’s our way of keeping things clear and building trust — no room for doubts or question marks.
Even better? It’s a chance to learn from each other. You can explore how #Defyx works under the hood, contribute to its development, and help us make it even better.

We’ll keep you posted — stay tuned!
